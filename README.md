Level: Beginner  
Technologies: Cloud IDE, Java EE   
Summary: In collaboration with Codenvy we have created demos for running JBoss development using their cloud based IDE developement environment. Codenvy provided us with additional memory for our demos so that we can run JBoss software. Codenvy also provides developers with runners so that developers can deploy their code. We have provided a couple of demos using the Clodenvy platform with Red Hat software.   
Prerequisites: None  
Target Product: WildFly  
Product Versions: WildFly 8.1  

What is it?
-----------
The Codenvy Cloud IDE demo demonstrates
 * How you can use a Cloud based Broswer IDE to develop java EE project only using a browser. No need to install a JDK, maven, git etc.
 * We also provide a runner based on WildFly 8.1 where you can test you java ee application, directly from the Browser IDE without having to install a server environment
 * You can then connect your project with Openshift and deploy your newly developed project in a production environment, all directly from you Browser.
 * 

All you have to do start a demo is to click on the accompanied link.

System requirements
-------------------
None, except for a resonable new browser. ;-)


Build and Deploy the Quickstarts
--------------------------------
When the projects are imported in to the Codenvy IDE they are automatically built, but you can triggger a build menu in the Codenvy IDE. To deploy you need to press the run button or again use the menu option.
